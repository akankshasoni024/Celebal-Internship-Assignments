NodeJs-A2/ – File manager using Node.js fs module
NodeJs-A3/ – Callback to Promise refactoring and practice
NodeJs-A4/ – Simple Express server with basic routing
NodeJs-A5/ – Express CRUD app with routes and models
NodeJs-A6/ – User API using Express with dummy data
NodeJs-A7/ – JWT Authentication with token middleware
NodeJs-A8/ – Advanced Express App with file upload and weather API integration
FSModule/ – Practice with Node.js React Weather & File Upload App
Practice/ – Miscellaneous practice scripts (events, os, utilities)


#### 🛠️ Tech Stack:

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Multer, Axios, CORS
* **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios
* **API:** [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)


### 🧑‍💻 How to Run

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akankshasoni024/Celebal-Internship-Assignments.git
cd Celebal-Internship-Assignments
```

#### 2. Setup & Run Backend

```bash
cd NodeJs-A8/express-server
npm install

# Add .env file with:
# WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key

node server.js
```

#### 3. Setup & Run Frontend

```bash
cd NodeJs-A8/express-client
npm install
npm start
```

Now visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


### 📦 Sample `.env` file

```env
PORT=5000
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
```

### 💡 What I Learned

* Setting up and handling file uploads with Multer
* Using third-party APIs in Express
* Creating full-stack apps with React + Express
